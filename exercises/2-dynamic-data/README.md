#### Dynamic data and template syntax

**To do:**
1. Show the application version in the header
2. Show available budget and the sum of logged days (for sum use reactive declaration - $)
3. Show a warning "Out of money!" only when the number of logged days is equal or larger than budget 
4. Show a list of projects (use HTML "table" tag)
5. For every project show a button "Mark as done", but only when a project is still open
